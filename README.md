# Compute Game AI

The Compute Game AI module taught students basic Neural Network types such as the multi layered perceptron and radial basis function. 

## Assignment

The assignment was to compare a RBF and a MLP for approximating a fixed function.

## Submission

To aid in my analysis I wrote a C++ application that simulates both neural networks when presented with an XML file.
